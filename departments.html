     <h3 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT CSE AND IT DEPARTMENT</h3>
     <p>The department of Computer Science and Engineering offers an undergraduate engineering degree program since the establishment of the university named 'West Bengal University of Technology' in the year 2001 (now renamed Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad University of Technology,) with a view to offer quality higher education to numerous worthy young fellows as well as to meet the gigantic demand of highly qualified specialists in the field.</p>
     <br>
     <p>The department also offers postgraduate engineering degree program since the year 2011. The university curriculum aims to give theoretical and practical knowledge in the areas of Advances of computer science. A post-graduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering is a must if students aspire to set himself / herself apart from the anonymous mass of "computer professionals" and to assume a leading role in transforming the industry, be it through research, advanced development, teaching, or entrepreneurship.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>The Department of Computer Science & Engineering is continuing this legacy by advancing the frontiers of computing. We have a three-fold mission: to create, disseminate knowledge, and to provide service to our communities. On the research front, our faculty, staff, and students are exploring innovative ideas in various areas of computer science.</p>
     <br>
     <p>The Department has a comprehensive university curriculum on topics related to all aspects of Computer Hardware and Software with an emphasis on practical learning. The course structure is updated and includes courses on nascent topics to equip our students with the latest developments in Computer Science and Engineering.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>The department of Information of Technology existed from the very beginning, while Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology set out its journey for imparting quality engineering education. Since then, the department has evolved with different sort of changes to cope up with the changing requirements from IT industry. Being directed by the University Curriculum, department has spread its wing to impart modern technologies among the students. Currently, department is run by eight experienced & dynamic Faculties and six caring & seasoned Lab Instructors along with world class infrastructures and other facilities.
        This is the place where future of computing lies. The department aims to be a centre of excellence in providing in-depth technical knowledge and research with state of the art laboratory infrastructure. The department’s main focus is to produce multitalented students to be employed in top MNCs/ Government Sector/Higher Education/Research & Development/Entrepreneurship from the very beginning and also make them capable to work in cross disciplinary platform.</p>
     <br>
     <p>The Department has state-of-the-art laboratory infrastructure named 'Centre of Excellence in Computing & Informatics' (CECI) and computing equipment supported by high speed Ethernet and wireless networks. It has also various subscriptions of Online Journals (IEL) and offline journals.</p>
     <br>
     <h3 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT NON-CSE/IT</h3>
     <p>The department has special labs like Advance VLSI Lab, Innovation lab, Advance Networking Lab to encourage students to perform innovative projects and advance research works. Many research papers (SCI and reputed Journals, IEEE and non IEEE Conferences) are published by our students on a regular basis. Students are encouraged to take part in National and International innovative competitions. One of our student groups received the 1st runner up prize (USD 5000) in Texas instrument Innovation Challenge 2015 as a result of our constant motivation and guidance. In 2010, one of the groups of ECE Dept. has been awarded as finalist in the “CADENCE DESIGN” organized by CADENCE Bangalore, India. Few student papers have been selected as best papers in IEEE conferences in last 3 years. Teachers and students are motivated to file PATENTS of their research works. Few patents have been filed already by the teachers and students of this department.</p>
<br>
        <p>The alumni of the department are well placed in academia, NGOs and in government and private sector. We have an Alumni advisory Board consists of Alumni who are now in core hardware industry like MICROCHIP-USA, INTEL-USA, TI, AMD, FUJITSU, WIPRO, TCS, CTS, IBM, INFOSYS, ICICI, GOOGLE, STANDARD CHARTERED, GOOGLE etc and also doing research works/higher study in National/International universities/IITs/IISCs like IISC Bangalore, IIT Chennai, IIT Kharagpur, Arizona State University, Colorado State University, Florida university, Louisiana State university etc. This alumni advisory board provides unique opportunities for aspiring students by sharing their skills and experiences.</p>
